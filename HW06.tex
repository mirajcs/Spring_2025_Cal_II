# A Spherical water tank, $24ft$ in diameter, sits atop of \(60ft\) tower. The tank is filled by a hose attached to the bottom of the sphere. If a \(1.5\) horse power pump is used to deliver water upto the tank, how long will it take to fill the tank? (One horse power = \(550ft-lb\) of work per second)
